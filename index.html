      <div class="card">
        <h3>🌱 Humble Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 2016 through community initiative led by <strong>Baduru Aluma</strong>, the school began with lessons conducted under trees due to lack of infrastructure.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>🏫 Overcoming Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          With no classrooms or teacher housing, lessons were held in rented grass-thatched structures. Despite this, learning never stopped.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>🤝 Community Innovation</h3>
        <p>
          To support struggling parents, the school accepted food items as fees and encouraged sports and teamwork as tools for growth and unity.
